## How to apply for a loan?

- On the homepage of the UI, there's an interest predictor which shows the total amount along with interest rate & monthly installments.
- User can use the slider to change the amount and set it anything between $500 to $5000.
- User can also use the second slider to change the term length anything between 6 to 24 months.
- After setting up the proper interest rate, user can click the `GET STARTED` button to start the application process.
- The form is a 3-step procedure which includes personal details, business details & a confirmation and agreement page.
- Once this is done, user can view the submitted applications by clicking the `MY LOANS` link in the sidenav, where they can request for cancellation of loans. (This page is not implemented)
